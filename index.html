<h2>About</h2>
<p>
I like learning, making stuff, and collaborating with others to create change.
</p>
<p>
I am a co-organizer for <a href = "http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesTC/">PyLadies Twin Cities</a>, a local chapter of a national organization of 
women who love programming in the Python Language. I attend regular meetings of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PyMNtos-Twin-Cities-Python-User-Group/">PyMNtos</a>,
the local Python user group. I am also a member of <a href="http://opentwincities.org/">Open Twin Cities</a>, a local group that collaboratively 
uses and creates technology for social good.
</p>
<p>
In my day job, I am a research analyst (aka "data storyteller") at the <a href= "http://www.bluegreenalliance.org"> BlueGreen Alliance</a>, 
a national coalition of labor unions and environmental groups. I work on using data to show our members and allies how we can reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions 
while building a clean and efficient economy. I also know quite a bit aboutfrastructure and supply chains. I am currently building my technical data analysis skills using Python.
</p>
I'm also crafty, I like to ride bikes, and I enjoy hunting for fossils and fungi.
