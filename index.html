        <p>Hello! My name is Roxanne Johnson and I am a research analyst at a nonprofit that works to address environmental challenges while building a stonger and fairer economy. I am interested in how we learn, understand, and share information with each other, and how we can work together using that information to create a future in which we want to live. I like to connect with curious people and think interesting thoughts.</p>
