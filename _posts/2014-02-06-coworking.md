title:  "Co-Working and Being around Other Weirdos"

My entire department is in an office in a city that isn’t where I live, so my meetings with them are on the phone. We tried video, but it turned out to be kind of a pain so we don’t do that anymore. Even among my department, I am an outlier. No one does what I do, exactly so I seldom feel like there are other staff I can reach out to with questions about specific analysis techniques, software, or data visualization. Additionally, I feel kind of isolated in my office despite being in the same space as other staff here because no one here is even in my department. Plus, our office is on two levels with three of us separated from the others so I have to go through at least two doors and up stairs if I want to see most of the folks here. I don’t have many regularly scheduled meetings with other staff, so often I’m just on my own to work on my projects. I do check in regularly with my supervisor but it’s seldom more than a quick check-in.

On the plus side, I have a lot of freedom and flexibility to work on my projects- to take ownership of them, make them into a cool combination of what I was asked to do and what I think they could or should be. But sometimes it’s challenging for me to work so much on my own.

An additional challenge is that I also feel like a social outlier here. At my previous job, I felt like I fit in much better than I do here… Here I think people think I’m kind of a weirdo. Which isn’t bad, but sometimes I just need to be around other weirdos.

Thus, I recently joined a co-working and collaborative space for one day a week. I love it because the atmosphere is very different from my office- it’s full of freelancers, consultants, entrepreneurs, people who are their own bosses and people who are trying to find their way to work they love. The space was described to me as a “choose your own adventure” for work when I toured, and I couldn’t resist that. Also they have a bean bag pit and a meeting space that is in a tent that has couches to sit on, inside the tent. I love it!

I like the idea of being in a place where  people seem really interested in what work others are bringing there, and learning about what it is that really interests you. The space also has event planners that plan social events as well as more professional-style events, and it seems like people there are into skill-sharing, collaborative problem solving, and team trouble shooting.

It seemed like a great opportunity to go and learn about what others are doing that I might like to do (like more data visualization), as well as a place to network, feel inspired, and explore wacky ideas that could turn into something grand. I’ve found the atmosphere and the interactions I’ve had so far to be rejuvenating and I’m excited to think up new ways to use this as a resource to do my work better.
