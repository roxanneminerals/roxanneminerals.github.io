Oops, a month went by...

I was in a groove, feeling good about my work and where it was going but then I hit this nebulous anti-clarity blob that has me feeling kind of lost. Right now, three of the four or five projects I’m working on are not very well defined and I’m not even sure if they are possible. One is well-supported and has the buy-in of two other folks, which I find reassuring, but the other two… well. And these three all have the shortest deadlines!

I was waiting for more structure, more guidance, some kind of input from higher-up but unfortunately that’s just not possible sometimes. So I decided to forge ahead, and we’ll see what happens.

Of course, the cool thing about these projects is that no one is doing stuff like this- they’re interesting and exciting new ideas. But therein lies the challenge- no one has done it! Post normal science indeed.

I think for me personally, the hard part is that such a high percentage of my near-term workload is these things that require figuring out. Also, the stuff that has a plan has deadlines that are farther away so I find it hard to justify working on those. But I should, because maybe all I need is the motivation that comes from what my AmeriCorps boss used to call a “feeling of accomplishment” or FOA.
