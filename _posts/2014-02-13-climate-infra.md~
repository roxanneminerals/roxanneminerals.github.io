title:  "Climate Impacts of Repairing Infrastructure"
---

I went to a briefing on the hill yesterday that was arranged to educate staffers about the importance of infrastructure repair. The briefing focused on Repair America, the BlueGreen Alliance campaign for repairing infrastructure and fighting climate change, and the DeLauro Infrastructure Bank Bill which is one potential mechanism for funding some of this work. One of the comments made by my colleague Zoe Lipman was that the work we do to repair infrastructure and ensure resilience in the face of climate change should also reduce our contribution to climate change. One example she provided was that fixing leaky water pipes not only conserves water, but it also conserves the energy required to pump that water.

I was reading today about a [study](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3022638/these-are-the-states-that-wont-be-ready-for-future-climate-disasters) that looked for climate key words in state hazard mitigation plans, finding that there are differences in state approaches to hazard planning that reflect awareness of climate change risks. So the questions I see that naturally follow are these:

    What is the benefit of understanding the effect that climate change has on risk and hazard in states?
    What is the benefit of addressing repairing infrastructure and reducing climate impacts at the same time?

We have seen the answer to the first question fairly regularly in the recent past; extreme weather events such as flooding, drought, winter storms, hurricanes, extreme cold and heat are becoming more intense, less predictable, and hitting areas of the country that havenâ€™t had to deal with them before. The effects of a changing climate affects risk and hazard planning in a very serious way. Understanding the possible scenarios and discussing options can ensure that plans are in place in an unlikely but possible extreme weather event. Additionally, being aware that these problems may be worse in the future can encourage long term planning to increase efficiency of infrastructure systems- for example, an area with increasing drought might invest in water pipe repair in the short term but also invest in longer term strategies, like local efficiency standards for appliances that use water, or developing innovative low-use practices in water- intensive industry or agriculture.

The second question of why we want to address both infrastructure and climate at the same time seems to be something that people are just starting to ask. One answer on the investment side is that the awareness of climate change and its impacts can allow for a greater return on investments we make now. Thinking strategically in order to make investments that repair infrastructure in a way that increases efficiency will get better returns than rebuilding the same systems we have now. It may be more expensive up front, but over time we can save money and energy while reducing carbon pollution.

Another answer that is focused on the feasibility of action side is that the awareness of climate benefits from repairing infrastructure can help prioritize infrastructure investments in a time where no one wants to increase spending. The climate component attracts a new group of people that may not have been interested before that now see the environmental benefit of advocating for these investments. Now there are more people demanding investments in the systems that we rely on every day.

Costs of dealing with climate change only increase over time; the more we do now to limit our contributions to climate change, the easier and cheaper it will be. Refusing to acknowledge climate change does not reduce its impacts or the cost of dealing with those impacts- in fact, it exacerbates the problems as well as the costs of dealing with the problems. We have an opportunity to repair our infrastructure in a way that generates many benefits beyond simply having functioning infrastructure, and I hope that we can take advantage of it.
