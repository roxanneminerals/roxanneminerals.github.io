A colleague of mine just reached out to me asking if I had suggestions for writing up a case study, as she hadn’t really done one before. I suddenly remembered that the qualitative research methods book has a chapter on that, and I can’t believe I didn’t read it while I was wracking my brain trying to think of what to write about for the case study in my CHP paper. While I still haven’t read it yet, I was able to tell her that my preference for writing the type of document she is working on is kind of standard:

Start big- describe the big picture situation, trends, how things have been changing over time. Identify the problem and (channeling one of my grad professors) create a very clear problem statement. Then zoom in on something specific- your case study- and highlight how the problem manifests itself in this particular case. Then talk about potential solutions for that specific case, and finally bring it back to potential solutions to the larger scale problem that you started with.

In the body of the text, what I like to do is identify the questions that I think people would ask about the situation, the case study, the problem, and the proposed solutions. I type them in a list, and then answer them like a worksheet. Then I remove the questions and make the text flow so that the reader’s questions are answered before they even knew they were asking them.

I’m so glad she asked me for suggestions, as it gave me an opportunity to reflect on the strategy that I’ve been using and write this brief note about it.
