It’s annual review time at work, which means that I get out last year’s review to see how far I’ve come since then. Maybe it’s because I’m relatively new to my career, or that there has been a lot of change at my job over the past year (changing departments and bosses, new role entirely) but it seems like I’m in a totally different place than I was last year. On the other hand, on the cusp of two more huge changes (I’ll be changing supervisors and our office is moving) I strangely feel a lot like I remember feeling last year- unsure of my future in the organization.

To me, the biggest or maybe most important progress I’ve made is designing my role better and embracing the opportunity I have to create things that interest me. I was updating my portfolio with projects that I’ve finished over the past year, and there are two pretty solid pieces of very different research that I am proud to have created. I’m perhaps even more proud that I created these without much support from my organization; I think to me it says that I really can work it as a consultant there. As a person who prefers more information to less (read: this blog title), this is both amazing and reassuring to me.

I’m much more optimistic about my upcoming projects than I was last year; I think I have a better understanding of the issues and how my organization works on them and more interest in the actual issue areas themselves. Plus, it looks like I get to do more collaborative work that won’t be writing things on my own and sending them along.

I’m also happy about the systems I’ve made habit now, like using Evernote to manage my project to-dos as well as a place I can look for details on work I completed in the last year for my review and my portfolio. I love reporting because it offers me the chance to reflect and see how far I’ve come, and to remember that I have actually accomplished things. But it also allows me to look forward and improve on things that could be better, and to change things that aren’t working. Looking through the past and present helps me map out what I’d like to prioritize in terms of professional development in the future. For example, I want to formally declare goals of learning more about data analysis in my goals for next year, and I’ve identified solid steps ([Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) MOOCs) to do that.

One thing I’ve changed is the review form. It currently asks about last year’s goals: what was successful, and what wasn’t. It later asks for new goals for the upcoming year. However, there are no metrics. How can you tell if you were successful if there are no metrics?! I want more information, I use more information, so I added that. I realize that most of this review is for myself, and last year I don’ t think my supervisor ever even read my review so I decided just to make it useful for me.

It suddenly occurred to me that some staff might use the work outlined in the organizational work plan for identifying upcoming goals- those come with metrics. But I don’t think I have any of those. Well, I came up with something to try- I think the process is iterative and that I’ll keep tweaking it over time as I come up with new or improved strategies. I love that kind of stuff, but it requires that you keep more data! #TrackThatStuff
