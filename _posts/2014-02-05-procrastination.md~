title:  "Procrastination"
---

I’m working on a presentation of some research I’ve been working on (off and on) for about a year, and I just don’t want to do it. It’s not that I don’t want to give the presentation, or that I don’t want to share my work. I’m not exactly sure what it is but I just don’t want to put together the presentation. To conquer my procrastination, I think I have to determine what exactly it is that I am avoiding.

I think maybe I would like feedback from others that I’m not getting. The most challenging part of the paper for me is the language and messaging; it’s the question of why the organization is interested in the research. This is the part that is most important in the presentation! I could use help from my colleagues, but it’s hard for me to get that help, partly because my department is in DC and I don’t want to bother them. They don’t have a ton of time and while they are willing to talk and have useful experience and resources to share, I don’t have a good, regular way to be in touch with them. We have a weekly check-in but it seems like more reporting than collaborating.

The new internal branding guide helps, maybe I’ll take a closer look at that language. I also have many useful comments from a reviewer in the paper draft, and I have scheduled a call with my co-presenters tomorrow to discuss coordination of our upcoming conference workshop. I have also set up a time to do a run-through with an audience- my coworkers and colleagues- which I hope will inspire me to put some work into creating a good presentation. And I have the timely experience of both listening to and hearing about really poor presentations recently, which motivate me to do better.

I do want to share what I’ve been working on because people are excited about it. I do want to engage with people about this issue because I think it’s interesting and I now know quite a bit about it. I want to connect with folks in the hopes that my work can help them do their work, as theirs has helped with mine. I feel like part of team CHP; the folks I’ve talked to while working on this project are folks I enjoy working with, and they are also the ones who are excited about this work. They are the rest of the team I’ve weaseled my way into- and they appreciate that I weaseled in! They want to engage, take advantage of my work, collaborate.

Now that I’ve eaten and thought it out (on Tumblr!) maybe I can make it happen. Go Team CHP!
