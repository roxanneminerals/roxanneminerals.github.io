title:  "Career Exploration Trip- Twin Cities!"
category: community
---

As a member of the Student Relations Committee of the [Humphrey School Alumni Board](https://www.hhh.umn.edu/our-leadership/alumni-board), I was part of the team that planned a Career Exploration Trip for the Twin Cities. Previously, trips were planned for current students to travel to DC and Chicago, meet alumni, and hear about their careers. Last year the Twin Cities was added. 

The day consisted of three panels, categorized by sector: nonprofit, private, and government. We started at the YWCA in downtown Minneapolis, made our way to Target, and ended at Minneapolis Central Library. My colleague Sarah Berke and I planned the nonprofit panel. I stuck around for the whole day, and it was really great to hear about what some amazing alumni are doing now and the advice they had for current students. We had a great group of folks that volunteered their time to make a great event.

We ended with a reception planned by the Boardâ€™s Alumni Relations Committee.
