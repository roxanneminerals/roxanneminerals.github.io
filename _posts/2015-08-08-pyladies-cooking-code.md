title:  "PyLadies: Cooking Code for Breakfast"
---

You may recall that myself and PyLady friend [Carole](https://twitter.com/CaroleJesse?lang=en) organized a [beginner cohort](link to post: PyLadiesTC Beginner Cohort at PyMNtos) to go through Coursera classes on Python in late 2014. We didn’t stop there! Our other organizers, [Dana](https://twitter.com/DanaKE?lang=en), Moni, and later [Michelle](https://twitter.com/michellecohrene?lang=en) joined in and we renamed our meetups to “Cooking Code for Breakfast”.

We continued our cohort into the spring/summer, but without a specific class. Ladies just came to work and to share, and just hang out. I am really proud of all the ladies in our group, we are amazing! Also, I got to spend [Galentine’s day](http://parksandrecreation.wikia.com/wiki/Galentine's_Day_(event)) with them! I made a PyLadies Galentine using CodeSkulptor and the skills I learned in the interactive gaming class.

I was also super excited to spend the Pi Day of the century (3/14/15) with them all at Seward Co-op <3

Also in March, we branched out a little when Jackie started RLadies. We decided to jointly call ourselves PyRUs, and host joint events at the PybRary- our library, coworking, and meeting space. There are several of us who work with data and are interested in both Python and R, so it seemed to make sense.
