This past weekend I attended [Hack for MN 2014](http://opentwincities.org/events/2014/06/21/hack-for-mn-2014/), Minnesota’s [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/) event, organized nationally by [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org/). Minnesota’s event partnered with the Minnesota Interagency Council on Homelessness and MN.IT (the state’s government information technology people) to do a service design challenge focused on ending veteran homelessness in the state.

I went to work a bit with the folks I met at [Capitol Code](http://opentwincities.org/events/2014/02/22/capitol-code/) on the API Store, and I spent some time floating around and working on other random projects.

AND! I met [Dana](https://twitter.com/DanaKE?lang=en), one of the founders of [PyLadiesTC](http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesTC/): a local chapter of an international organization of women who program in Python. I told her that I work with data and am interested in building my data analysis skills but wasn’t sure how to do that, exactly. I am so excited to join up with these ladies!
