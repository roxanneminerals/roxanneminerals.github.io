  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I finally made it to the YQdio! I&#39;ve been meaning to go to something since I first tried a Yoga Quest
last summer. If you haven&#39;t done a quest with these folks before, the way it works is that there is a script
based on a movie or episode of a tv show and the characters each have yoga poses associated with them, which
you learn before the quest. Whenever the quest leader says the name of a character, you do their pose.</p>

<p>The script I did last summer was for the Star Trek (original series) episode Mirror, Mirror- also known as
the one where evil Spock has a goatee and Uhura wears a midriff shirt (those abs!!). It was absolute hilarity
and I&#39;ve been meaning to go back ever since.</p>

<p>I finally made it to the actual studio for a feminist book club where we read The Beauty Myth:  How Images of Beauty Are Used Against
Women by Naomi Wolf. In this club meeting we talked about the first half-ish of the book, through the Culture
chapter. The people who went were delightful; in the intros we were asked to share a fun fact and it turned
into a conversation about our childhood toys and interesting ways that we played with them (mine was stop motion
Star Trek; there was other stop motion animation, some lesbian Barbies, fan fiction horses, and
lots and lots of pez dispensers).</p>

<p>The conversation opened with a discussion about the book being a summarized version of the academic
literature that really seemed to speak to people already onboard with the message. It was written in 1991
so we also talked about ways that the content is dated (pre-internet! before terms like man-scape!). Some 
of us had issues with the citations, others with the tone. Some thought it was dry, some thought it was
pretentious. At some point we had a conversation about &quot;4th wave&quot; feminism which I related to because I
found this 3rd wave book very foreign-feeling, even though I was around (I was 10) when it came out and I think
of many of my friends as 3rd wave. </p>

<p>Some highlights of what I took away from the conversation:</p>

<p>The Work Chapter. What does it mean to look &quot;professional&quot;? What differences in interactions do we experience based on our decisions
of what we wear? Examples: deciding not to wear makeup to a meeting with a client who has hit on you in the past; dressing in a nerd
t-shirt and jeans instead of a dress at a technical conference because you want technical conversations and not just to get hit
on; wearing a wedding ring for the same reason. What difference in interactions do we experience based on what we look like?
Examples: not getting hit on while wearing a dress at a technical conference because maybe you aren&#39;t as &quot;conventionally attractive&quot;;
approachability and &quot;resting bitch face&quot;; not perceiving discrimination because of looking female; perceiving that people don&#39;t take 
you seriously because you&#39;re short, young, queer, fat.</p>

<p>We also talked about ways to respond when a male colleague tells you to smile. I liked the suggestion to redirect and say, &quot;I&#39;m all out of smiles, but try 
[male coworker&#39;s name] over there, I think he has some!&quot;. What I like about it is that if a guy just says this out of habit and not malicious intent 
(which I like to think is the reason most dudes say this kind of stuff) and has never
thought about how women might not appreciate it, it doesn&#39;t humiliate him- it just asks him to think about his action in a way he hasn&#39;t before. 
We had a whole conversation about how for learning to happen and for behavior to change that it needs to be 
okay to make mistakes and it helps when people can talk about it with each other- especially across gender lines.
 I&#39;ve been having this conversation since PyCon! (That&#39;s another post)</p>

<p>The Culture Chapter. The book talks a lot about the feminism in Women&#39;s magazines, which I thought was a little foreign to me so I instead thought 
about Pinterest, Facebook, and ad algorithms. They recommend things to users based on all kinds of input, and what is that doing to our perception
of beauty? Another person talked about Fan Fiction and how it was interesting that so many women write about male characters, which led 
to a conversation about how male characters are relatable because they are actual people, with flaws and character, not just plot devices.
I have never read FanFic but I thought it was really interesting when someone said that fanfic allows us to create transformative works, giving an 
example of a gender-swapped Sherlock who amazingly as a woman can be just as much a culturally-accepted asshole. That&#39;s revolutionary!!</p>
