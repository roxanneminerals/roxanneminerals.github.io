  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I just finished, well, “finished”, a second draft of a study I’m writing pretty much all by myself. I had a really hard time because I would make a list of things I needed to change, and as I completed the list, I would add about as many new things to the list as I checked off. It just became a self-perpetuating list of things to do with the paper, and the things kept getting smaller or more tangential.</p>

<p>A photo and quote on the Humans of New York Facebook page from January 10th really hit home for me while this was happening. It was a photo of an older man, and the quote was the following: &quot;I don’t have any deadlines now that I’m writing for myself, but I’m having trouble finishing things. It’s much easier to stop when something is due than to stop when it’s good.“</p>

<p>Since no one tells me when I need to stop, and apparently I am incapable of setting deadlines that will matter to me, I just don’t stop. The rate at which I made changes slowed almost to zero as minute changes took longer and longer to complete, stretching out into this infinity that reminded me of studying limits in calc II my freshman year of college. I needed to stop before that rate dropped below a certain level, but how do you determine what that level is or when you’ve crossed it? There has to be some sort of test.</p>

<p>My other challenge is that I really only have one reviewer that provides substantive feedback for this paper, and I don’t want to send her 80 slightly different copies like I did to my adviser while working on my thesis for my graduate degree. But how do you know when the changes you’ve made are enough? Also, I’ll admit that sometimes I do the easy edits to procrastinate the harder ones. Not sure if that’s good or not. On one hand, I get them done. On the other, I’m putting off the harder ones that are probably higher priority.</p>

<p>I’ve also been thinking a lot recently about the ability to put things aside. I was at a talk last week called <a href="http://www.walkerart.org/calendar/2014/creative-entrepreneurship-making-world-suck-l">Creative Entrepreneurship: Making the World Suck Less</a> given by Alexis Ohanian, cofounder of Reddit, and Matt Decuir, founder of <a href="http://omgtransit.com/">OMG Transit</a>. They were talking about entrepreneurship, quitting your day job, and making a go of whatever it is you want to work on. One of the things Matt talked about was making a deal with yourself to not worry about finding a job for a certain amount of time (I think he gave himself two months) and just giving whatever your thing is an honest go. Not a half-assed go, where you’re also looking for jobs and worrying, but a real go- where you put that stuff aside. I think the key to my conundrum is figuring out when in the process it makes sense to do different types of edits, and putting all the other edits aside. That way I’m not completely overwhelmed by the ever-growing list of disparate things*.</p>

<p>Here are my ideas to try:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Determine the appropriate number of drafts. Is this a long term project? Is it an internal memo or issue brief that just has to document the literature? Is it a paper with many disparate sections? Do some sections require data, and does that data exist or does someone have to go pull it from the ether? Will it be published? Who needs to approve it? Which copies do they need to see?</p></li>
<li><p>Identify specific goals for each draft. Is an outline a sufficient first draft? Does the format or methodology need to be approved before any further work is done? Is it a simple project where the content exists and just needs to be pulled together? Is it a complex project involving creating the methodology?</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize major tasks for each draft’s goals. The last draft is the one you read over for typos and flow. The first draft should have a strong problem statement as well as identify the methodology and what the outcome or outputs will be. Does the second draft need to be &quot;done” to the point where you can present the results as a working paper at a conference? (This is a not-so-subtle description of my current situation)</p></li>
<li><p>Set up a rough timeline working backwards from when you want to be done. As edits come up, put them on a post-it and stick it where in the process it best fits. Deal with it only when it is time for that stage of the process.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Each project I do teaches me more skills and tools to deal with whatever kinds of challenges come up in all kinds of projects I do. I’m hoping that I’ve learned something by jotting this down that will help me see things more clearly and be able to chose not to spend a week on five edits for the next draft of this paper.</p>

<p>*A note about lists of disparate things: I had a professor in graduate school who would often make lists on the white board, and for a while I couldn’t tell why but the lists just confused me. Each element made sense, the topic of the list made sense, but for some reason they just didn’t sit right. One day I realized it was because the things weren’t the same type, it was as if she was putting numbers in a list with letters. After I figured that out, I was much more relaxed about the lists. I blame my math degree and the study of sets for this one.</p>
