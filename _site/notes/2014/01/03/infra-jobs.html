  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I just finished drafting the third report in a series we’re doing for one of our campaigns. The reports are focused on identifying the job creation opportunities of maintaining, repairing, or renovating different types of infrastructure in specific states. I’ve been using the <a href="http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/">ASCE Report Card for America’s Infrastructure</a> as a starting point to determine what kinds of investments need to be made in each of the states for each type of infrastructure system (roads and bridges, freight rail, transit, waste water, drinking water, electricity, natural gas, and smart grid) and then either using the numbers they have or digging around to find more recent numbers.</p>

<p>Some states have state report cards done by local branches or chapters of ASCE, but some don’t. The state report cards I’ve seen are all pretty old, so my strategy became to look up where they got their information and go look for a more recent publication with a newer number. Some of the infrastructure systems (like drinking water) have federal agencies that report to Congress periodically, and these studies are a gold mine for information on investment needs by state.</p>

<p>For other infrastructure systems (like electricity), it can be really difficult to find good numbers because there’s no one agency- like the state department of transportation, for example- that publishes a long term plan and what the investment costs will be. For those types, I generally tried to find a project that was either already underway or had been approved but hadn’t started yet, such as a transmission project aiming to improve reliability of the electric grid in a state or region within a state.</p>

<p>Electricity in particular is also difficult because planning, generating, distributing, selling, buying, using, and regulating electricity requires so many types of organizations and the rules are different in different places. Electric grids also cross state boundaries, and many utilities serve multiple states; distribution projects in particular often involves more than just one state.</p>

<p>Once I find the investment numbers, I use them with jobs numbers I’ve found floating around the internet. They are generally well-cited numbers from think tanks or government agencies that were developed using the IMPLAN or RIMS II input-output models. I’m still learning my way around those models- I’ve never used either of them, but I work with their results a lot. I’m trying to get a better handle on their assumptions and definitions of things like “jobs so that I can be more informed when I use numbers that came out of those models.</p>

<p>I always think of my high school chemistry teacher when I do any calculations with units; he taught us to use bridges (there’s a good demonstration here) and I have found that to be immensely helpful with anything more complicated that canceling out one unit. Which is all this calculation required, but I thought of him nonetheless.</p>

<p>I basically started with investment in $B and multiplied by jobs numbers, usually in the form of jobs/$B. As long as your billions line up, $B cancels out leaving you with jobs- easy peasy! Then for projects or plans that have time spans, I divide by years (or multiply by 1/year) to get jobs/year. Then I have like-terms and I can add up the number of jobs that we might expect to be created or maintained per year in a state.</p>

<p>This math is relatively straight-forward and good for a back-of-the-envelope calculation, but one of the challenges is that the jobs numbers were obtained through different models, which probably have different assumptions and may not be entirely comparable. So I’m still struggling with what the assumptions are and what that means for the results and what is considered &quot;acceptable” to do with those results. I’m not an economist.</p>

<p>A second challenge I think about a lot is connected to the first but more focused on communicating the results. What exactly is considered a “job” and what does it mean to “create or maintain” one? My understanding is that IMPLAN counts full time, part time, and temporary jobs all together; it is also a snapshot model so it assumes that all the money is spent at once and all else remains equal.</p>

<p>Additionally, these investment numbers are usually a combination of money already being spent or allocated and money that should be spent but isn’t there (funding gap), so it’s misleading to just say you expect to “create” these jobs. That’s one reason we added “or sustain”. Another more insidious reason we add that is that all jobs are “temporary” in some fashion, and even more so with things like infrastructure repair because those jobs are project- based by design. But some are also very permanent jobs, like manufacturing components for road repair. That always needs to be done, because there are always projects. In a way they depend on a project being funded, but it’s more like they depend on a certain number of projects being funded over a time period- something a model like IMPLAN is not equipped to deal with.</p>

<p>I’ve learned a lot putting these reports together, and each one I do gets easier as I learn to manage them better and as I gain a little more insight. They also get some pretty serious press, which is exciting to see- people are fired up about infrastructure! I’ve also found that I am learning more general research skills- what to keep track of, how to organize sources, what notes to keep on how data is obtained… I love learning how to make my life easier! Except that it doesn’t really make life easier, it makes it more interesting- really what it does is make habits out of things you used to think about, freeing up your thought process to work on more complex problems.</p>
