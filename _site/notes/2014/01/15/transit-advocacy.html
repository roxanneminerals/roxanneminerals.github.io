  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Yesterday I decided at the last minute to go to an event called <a href="http://afscmemn.org/event/transportation-jobs-equity-forum-everyone-deserves-seat">Transportation, Jobs &amp; Equity Forum: Everyone Deserves a Seat</a>. The discussion was kind of a launch of the <a href="http://movemn.org/">MoveMN</a> campaign that’s aimed at pulling together a diverse coalition to address Minnesota’s transportation needs. The speakers included the following:</p>

<p>National Speakers
Larry Hanley, President, Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) International
Greg LeRoy Executive Director, Good Jobs First
Andrew Austin, Executive Director, Americans for Transit</p>

<p>Local Panel
Louis King, President &amp; CEO, Summit Academy OIC
Dorothy Maki, Vice President, ATU Local 1005
Harry Melander, President, Minnesota State Building &amp; Construction Trades Council (invited)
Barb Thoman, Executive Director, Transit for Livable Communities
Kenya McKnight, Met CouncilTransportation Advisory Board member and Bush Fellow
Peggy Flannegan, board member of the Native American Community Development Institute (NACDI) and executive director of the Children’s Defense Fund-MN</p>

<p>I went because it was advertised as a “robust discussion of the economic opportunities and social benefits of rapidly building out our transportation system with national experts and a local panel of advocates”. I’ve written about job creation opportunities of transit investments, but I’ve never worked specifically on transportation in any sort of depth so I thought it would be interesting to see what the conversation is here in Minnesota. Also, I have a special place in my heart for multimodal transportation.</p>

<p>Some members from the local ATU served a home cooked meal that was absolutely fantastic. The room was packed with people, and the event lived up to its advertisement. I guess I always knew that transit people were a passionate group, but this time I got to actually see it.</p>

<p>Some highlights for me:</p>

<p>I am curious about Good Jobs First. I’ve heard or read their name out there in my natural habitat, but never looked closely at their work. Greg LeRoy shared some findings from interesting looking reports they have produced, so I should remember to look them up. It looks like they are into jobs studies, which is kind of my wheelhouse. They are soon publishing a case study on St. Paul’s Union Depot <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/economicrecovery/">ARRA TIGER</a> funded project, and I’m interested in how they use a case study to shore up their modeled findings (I’m hoping that’s what they are doing) because that’s exactly what I want to do on one of my projects.</p>

<p>Larry Hanley, living legend, talked about the importance of organizing riders. This blew my mind. I immediately thought of of Tron and how in a similar way but in different clothes (suspenders instead of a light up body suit) Larry Hanley fights for the users. He told stories about riders he had met that assumed they didn’t have the power to change things. I am now aware that I myself am a disempowered transit user, accepting that I am destined to deal with the system as it is- where it takes me just as long to walk the mile and a half to work as it would to go out of my way on two buses. He also spoke extensively about how his work requires a new, innovative model of embracing community groups and gaining wider support for initiatives that will benefit his members as well as the broader community- it made me think about our work with unions and the value of the difference between forward-looking visionary action and operating business-as-usual while the world changes around us.</p>

<p>One of the questions that came up toward the end was from a guy who was in a union (AFSCME maybe? I need to take better notes) that represented workers that do road repair. He asked about how we can build this coalition so that it includes the road repair folks since the funding argument is so often roads and bridges versus transit. Greg LeRoy commented that we could make a jobs argument, pointing out that inner urban projects create more jobs than suburban sprawl type development. Another person said that we need to stop the mentality that we all need to get a piece of the pie each time, suggesting that if the coalition decides to work on one part of something one legislative session they can work on another issue the next session. This requires building trust and relationships.</p>

<p>This seems like a pretty universal struggle for us coalitions. I don’t have the answers, but I think that the question is coming up is a great first step.</p>

<p>I also liked that the folks who seemed to have been involved in last legislative session and for years before that said that this time we’re starting together, that more people are at the table in the beginning instead of being picked up along the way. It was exciting to see that everyone understood this to be a real advantage, and I hope that in February when we have our next national conference, that my organization can start there to launch our new campaign.</p>
