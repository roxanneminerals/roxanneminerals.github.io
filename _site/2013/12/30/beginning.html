    <p>I don’t believe in fate.</p>

<p>In fact, I used to tell people that while I don’t believe in fate, I do believe in statistics. I also believe that when people know you really well, it can maybe look like fate.</p>

<p>I had been going through a brief “let’s get back into reading about math” phase after going to the Science Museum of Minnesota’s <a href="http://www.smm.org/maya">Maya: Hidden Worlds Revealed</a> exhibit where Bill and I played a computer game teaching <a href="http://www.michielb.nl/maya/math.html">Maya math</a>, which is an exciting base 20. After a riveting lunch discussion about the concept of 0 and the cultural constraints and allowances associated with it, I went online to reserve books from the library and impulse shop Amazon for books on 0.</p>

<p>They came, and I didn’t read any of them. Work got crazy, and my brain shut off.</p>

<p>After about a month of this reading-less funk, mom n dad gave me the book <a href="http://www.simonsingh.net/Simpsons_Mathematics/">The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets</a> by Simon Singh for Xmas. More on the awesomeness of the book later, but let’s just say that if I believed in fate (which I don’t), I would think this was sent to me to get me back on track.</p>

<p>Long story short, the book was so awesome that it made me want to start reading the library books I had checked out, one of which was <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/economics/natural-resource-and-environmental-economics/why-we-disagree-about-climate-change-understanding-controversy-inaction-and-opportunity">Why We Disagree About Climate Change: Understanding Controversy, Inaction and Opportunity</a> by Michael Hulme. Despite the lack of an Oxford comma in the subtitle, this book is really fantastic. It starts with a discussion about the social meanings of climate, goes through some highlights of discoveries in climate change, and then has an incredible chapter on the performance of science, which discusses the nature of scientific knowledge and authority, the social contract with science, expectations of what science can do, and epistemology. This chapter brings together everything I should have learned in Science and Technology Policy while in grad school. The idea post-normal science (for which this blog is named) was covered in that class, and I was reminded of it again in this chapter- with the poignant assertion that climate change is exactly the type of situation where facts are uncertain, values are in dispute, the stakes are high, and the decisions are urgent- a case for post-normal science!</p>

<p>(Note: while certain facts are uncertain, that the earth is undergoing climate change as a result of human action is not one of them)</p>

<p>I have often felt like a fraud of a scientist; I despised lab and field science because it was tedious, and the social sciences always looked messy and full of assumptions to me. My credentials are not any specific scientific discipline because I couldn’t choose just one (and also see previous: tedious!) and I don’t think math counts as a “science”. But I often find that I enjoy scientists and I like to pretend I fit in with them. Growing up I watched a ton of Nova and Bill Nye and I never thought I would be anything but a scientist. </p>

<p>Now, just like Dr. Science, I have a Masters degree- in science! Specifically, in science, technology, and environmental policy. So I like to think of myself as a scientist, and I like to think I have some fancy credentials (a stinkin’ piece of paper with my name on it) to prove it. But then, what kind of scientist am I? In my job I do research, and while I sometimes get to do some of my own analysis (which is fun and sciencey) it’s never a specific discipline. More on what I actually do later.</p>

<p>My question was finally answered while I read this chapter on the performance of science. I am a post-normal scientist! While I am still fairly certain it’s not fate, I do think that the mathy Simpsons book was a very timely gift, and had the added bonus of leading me toward reconciling my post-normal science identify. Who wants to be normal, anyway?</p>

<p>Maybe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_science">Thomas S. Kuhn</a>…</p>

<p>Note: This was the first post of a Tumblr Blog titled “Diary of a Post-Normal Scientist”, which I kept for a little while. I have since moved the posts here.</p>
