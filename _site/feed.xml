&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start of the hack day, photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/robfargo&quot;&gt;Rob Davis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday June 20th was the first annual Twin Cities CycleHack event. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyclehack.com&quot;&gt;CycleHack&lt;/a&gt; started in 2014 in Glasgow, Scotland 
and this year it has become an international effort to make the world more sustainable through reducing the barriers to cycling. 
The inspiration for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyclehacktc.com&quot;&gt;CycleHack Twin Cities&lt;/a&gt; began with a visit from one of the Glasgow founders, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyclehack.com/the-team/&quot;&gt;Johanna Holtan&lt;/a&gt;. 
She came and talked at an &lt;a href=&quot;http://bikeablejo.com/2014/08/27/twin-cities-cycling/&quot;&gt;Open Twin Cities meetup&lt;/a&gt; about what they had done in 
Scotland, and the idea was born to do a CycleHack here in Minneapolis. Which, by the way, is currently the only US city to make it into the top 
20 in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://copenhagenize.eu/index/18_minneapolis.html&quot;&gt;Copenhagenize Index&lt;/a&gt; of bike friendly cities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To kick off our CycleHack, we started with some ideation to figure out what keeps people from riding bikes here in the 
Twin Cities, brainstormed ways to address those issues, and then we had a full hack day at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tcmaker.org/blog/&quot;&gt;Hack Factory&lt;/a&gt; 
where we worked on some hacks to address the things we identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the hack day, we had several groups create some incredible projects! For more pictures and stories, check out [@CycleHackTC]
(https://twitter.com/cyclehacktc) or our hashtag &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/cyclehacktc?src=hash&quot;&gt;#CycleHackTC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn Signal Backpack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the barriers identified was the concern that drivers don’t see cyclists or don’t know what they plan to do. This group prototyped an LED 
turn signal that would be placed in a mesh pocket on the outside of your backpack, so that drivers behind you could see when you plan 
to turn. It also has a signal for stop. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zzolo/signal&quot;&gt;Source code for Signal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bikeable.io&quot;&gt;bikable.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One group was interested in finding a better way for cyclists to choose routes using data that shows where cyclists actually ride. The 
thought was that Google Maps will give you a bike route, but won’t tell you if a road is in poor condition or has heavy car traffic.
The group used bike trip data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/local&quot;&gt;Strava&lt;/a&gt;, a way for users to upload comments or recommendations, 
and they added some collision data from a [ten year study from the city of Minneapolis on vehicle/bike collisions.]

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bikes on Buses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wbushey&quot;&gt;Bill&lt;/a&gt; worked on thinking through how it might work to collect data on whether bike racks on Metro Transit buses were available or in use. 
Starting with the physical question of how a sensor could be used to determine if bikes were already on the bus, he then considered 
how to get the data to transit users with bikes and how the system could get set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wbushey&quot;&gt;Bill&lt;/a&gt; discussing how the bureaucracy might deal with this technical solution 
to the problem, second photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jmkeuning&quot;&gt;James Keuning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bike Clutch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of us organizers (myself included) decided an hour before the end of hack day that we wanted to hack something, so we considered when you 
want to go out but don’t want to take a bag and you need to carry your phone, wallet, and keys. We recruited another team member and used 
a sewing machine to create a little clutch that we call the bike brand bike clutch that attaches to the front of your handlebars 
with velcro. It also has the word “bike” (hence the bike brand) on it, and the dot over the “i” is an LED, so it’s also a headlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoke Card&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This group was working on the problem that not knowing your rights or the law might keep people from biking, so they prototyped a spoke card 
that reminds cyclists of their rights and responsibilities on one side, and has a checklist on the other side with 
the appropriate steps if they are in an accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn Signal Helmet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One team had people who had to leave early so they didn’t present, but they worked on LEDs embedded in a bike helmet with programmed controls 
to create turn signals. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobypicture.com/user/gelicia/view/18234077&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(https://twitter.com/gelicia), Rachel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were other projects worked on by folks that couldn’t stay; some of them were uploaded to the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyclehack.com/location/minneapolis/&quot;&gt;global CycleHack Catalogue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hack Factory was an amazing donated space for our first CycleHack. They had equipment and tools galore (including a laser cutter 
for trained members to use), and everyone there was open and helpful. They were gracious hosts with “anything goes” and “figure it out” attitudes. 
We had materials donated by In the Heart of the Beast Theater, Ax-Man Surplus, and numerous friends and family so that people had all kinds of 
things to use for hacks, which really set the tone for thinking outside the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/bicycles/bike-box&quot;&gt;(bike) box&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideation process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent some time before the hack day brainstorming barriers to cycling and ideating hacks that would address the barriers we came up with. 
We asked folks when they registered to let us know if they had ideas to hack on, and we also had an Ideascale for people to post ideas and 
also vote on other ideas that were posted. We tabled at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://makerfairemsp.com/&quot;&gt;Twin Cities Maker Faire&lt;/a&gt;, where we asked people to 
think of any issues that may keep people from choosing to ride their bike. We wrote the barriers on index cards, and sorted them into six 
categories of things we could hack: the bike, the environment, the cyclist, clothing, navigation, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cyclehacktc_2015/ideation_full.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Ideation images&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brainstormed barriers, ideas to address the barriers, and suggestions for hacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday evening before the hack day, we did an ideation bike ride around the neighborhood to come up with any and all ideas for ways&lt;br /&gt;
to address some of the issues we had collected in those six categories. At the start, we did brief introductions and then our ride lead 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/michellecohrene&quot;&gt;Michelle&lt;/a&gt; and our volunteer ride mechanic Brian Fanelli from &lt;a href=&quot;http://morethanabicycle.com/recoverybikeshop.html&quot;&gt;Recovery Bike Shop&lt;/a&gt; 
explained the rules for the ride. 
Then the group set off to the first stop, at the green 
institute building off of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://midtowngreenway.org/about-the-greenway/&quot;&gt;Greenway&lt;/a&gt;. At this stop, we split into groups and each 
took a barrier written on an index card, and we took 10 
minutes to brainstorm hacks to solve the issue on the card. The two categories we did at this stop were hacking the bike and hacking clothing.&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, the group headed to Brackett Park, where we thought about hacking the environment and hacking navigation. Then onto the last 
stop at the Hack Factory, where we discussed hacking the cyclist and the culture. Throughout the evening we had some great (and some crazy) 
ideas and discussions. We talked about what it means for an intersection to be “good” for cyclists, how to keep from getting sweaty on 
your way to work, some of the current cycling infrastructure efforts in the neighborhood, and tons of other things.
One of my favorites was in the conversation about hacking the culture, and the problem that drivers seem to hate cyclists (and vice versa!). 
We recalled the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.citylab.com/commute/2015/02/dont-say-cyclists-say-people-on-bikes/385387/&quot;&gt;reframing how we talk about 
cyclists to “people on bikes”&lt;/a&gt;
 and drivers to “people in cars”, because it leads to a more civil debate, but also because here in Minneapolis, often people go back and forth 
between the two. We also talked about who identifies as a cyclist (kids, hipsters, lyrca dudes) and how it would be great to widen that to 
include all people who ride their bikes, independent of how much or how little they ride, what they wear, who they associate with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cyclehacktc_2015/ideation_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ideation Ride start, Greenway&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bike Demos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the attendees, Rachel, brought two bikes she had hacked before CycleHack to demonstrate. One was a backwards steering bike, and the other 
was a swing bike. Some of us tried out the swing bike!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cyclehacktc_2015/swing_bike.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The swing bike&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of hack day, we heard from Jason Tanzman at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyclesforchange.org/&quot;&gt;Cycles for Change&lt;/a&gt;, a community bike shop in St. Paul
working to to build a diverse and empowered community of bicyclists. They recently merged with &lt;a href=&quot;http://spokesconnect.org/&quot;&gt;SPOKES Bike Walk Connect&lt;/a&gt;, 
a similar organization in the Seward neighborhood working on the goal of getting more people biking and walking. 
Our ideation ride went past SPOKES, and its founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sheldonM&quot;&gt;Sheldon Mains&lt;/a&gt; was on the ride, sharing his hyper-local knowledge 
of activities and infrastructure initiatives that are going on right now. Both Cycles for Change and SPOKES have been working to reduce 
barriers to cycling in the Twin Cities, and it was great that they could be involved with CycleHack. The Twin Cities has a vibrant cycling community 
with many types of interests in improving the cycling experience here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cyclehacktc_2015/jason_c4c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jason from Cycles for Change&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversations, the projects, the people, our supporters, everything about CycleHack was incredibly inspiring and I think provided a unique 
addition to the existing efforts to improve cycling. After months of planning (that should have started much earlier than it did), 
it was really great to see everything come together and to see people so excited and invested in the spirit of the event. I hope that this hack day 
connected people to this amazing place we all live in and to each other. I also hope that the conversations and ideas we had were just
the beginning of an ongoing discussion to keep thinking up innovative ways to make things better and easier for people on bikes (which we now 
call POBs) here in the Twin Cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CycleHack Twin Cities couldn’t have happened without the generous support of our sponsors, so thanks very much to all sponsors and partners! &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CodeWork Unconference</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Unconference principles always tell you that the people who come are the right people. That has never felt more true
than at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://umncodework.github.io/&quot;&gt;CodeWork Unconference&lt;/a&gt; I went to today. The event was organized by some folks at the University of Minnesota’s
Institute for Advanced Study and drew people interested in discussing how code shapes our lives. These people were also interested 
in classics, rhetoric, code, data, ethics, virtual reality, privacy, comics, and even lichen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started the day with some background from the organizers and introductions, and then went right into the first session where 
I got to try out a Raspberry Pi with a camera module. I had previously only played &lt;a href=&quot;https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapter8.html&quot;&gt;Squirrel Eat Squirrel&lt;/a&gt; (a game written in Python, BTW) and 
unsuccessfully tried Minecraft. I gave up after falling in some water and didn’t really see the appeal of the game, probably because 
I’m old. We also played with some code that searched for tweets and printed them to a little board, which was pretty rad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch we went into our second session, where I got to talk about my favorite subject of late: data analysis in Python. I shared 
about my adventure trying to learn and some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PyLadiesTC/Dcubed-installfest-2015/blob/master/resources.md&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; I find really helpful, which led into a fantastic discussion about learning to program, 
the sort of mysticism around “coding”, and the uselessness of stating that you “just need to learn to code”. One of my favorite parts of the 
conversation was around the difference between identifying as a “programmer” or “developer” and the framework of using something like 
Python as one of may tools to accomplish a task or solve a problem. This really got at why I felt like I didn’t really fit in at PyCon 
last week! We were going to talk about citizen science as well but sadly didn’t get to it; we definitely need to do this again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third session I spent talking video games and trying out the Samsung Gear headset, which took each of us flying over… Iceland? Somewhere with 
beautiful waterfalls and vast expanses. I also went in some spaceship thing. We talked about video game worlds and how the player/user has to 
figure out what kind of world they’re in, like in any other story except more immersive. We had talked about some of my favorite stories at lunch 
(like Sophie’s World and the Neverending Story) that either break the fourth wall or otherwise have characters that in some way start 
to question and figure out their place inside the world in which the story takes place. In virtual reality, you have to navigate both the world 
that you enter and see while inside while remaining physically somewhere else, where you can bump into things or fall. We laughed about 
how we can end up in different parts of the room and be completely surprised by this when we emerge from that other world by removing 
the headset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also talked about diversity in game making, and the different stories that can be told when everyone makes games. I brought up one of my 
favorite games, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tamponrun.com/&quot;&gt;Tampon Run&lt;/a&gt;, a game created by a couple high school girls that were sick of the stigma against menstruating women’s bodies. 
they are two of my favorite heroes. In the game you throw tampons at the bad guys. They acknowledge that while the concept of the game may be strange that it’s more strange 
that we accept violence in video games and yet can’t talk about periods. #truth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just when you think it can’t get any better, I met a woman who shares my love of lichen, a guy who recommended the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://catalog.sevenstories.com/products/rise-of-the-videogame&quot;&gt;The Rise of the 
Video Game Zinesters&lt;/a&gt; (which I bought immediately on Amazon) as well as the MCTC zine collection, 
I learned about a hyperlocal independent movie theater, and I geeked out about bags and notebooks and why everything out there is somehow lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You guys, these are my people. I can’t wait til the next thing they do! It’s so.much.fun.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>YQdio Book Club: The Beauty Myth</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally made it to the YQdio! I’ve been meaning to go to something since I first tried a Yoga Quest
last summer. If you haven’t done a quest with these folks before, the way it works is that there is a script
based on a movie or episode of a tv show and the characters each have yoga poses associated with them, which
you learn before the quest. Whenever the quest leader says the name of a character, you do their pose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script I did last summer was for the Star Trek (original series) episode Mirror, Mirror- also known as
the one where evil Spock has a goatee and Uhura wears a midriff shirt (those abs!!). It was absolute hilarity
and I’ve been meaning to go back ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally made it to the actual studio for a feminist book club where we read The Beauty Myth:  How Images of Beauty Are Used Against
Women by Naomi Wolf. In this club meeting we talked about the first half-ish of the book, through the Culture
chapter. The people who went were delightful; in the intros we were asked to share a fun fact and it turned
into a conversation about our childhood toys and interesting ways that we played with them (mine was stop motion
Star Trek; there was other stop motion animation, some lesbian Barbies, fan fiction horses, and
lots and lots of pez dispensers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation opened with a discussion about the book being a summarized version of the academic
literature that really seemed to speak to people already onboard with the message. It was written in 1991
so we also talked about ways that the content is dated (pre-internet! before terms like man-scape!). Some 
of us had issues with the citations, others with the tone. Some thought it was dry, some thought it was
pretentious. At some point we had a conversation about “4th wave” feminism which I related to because I
found this 3rd wave book very foreign-feeling, even though I was around (I was 10) when it came out and I think
of many of my friends as 3rd wave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some highlights of what I took away from the conversation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Work Chapter. What does it mean to look “professional”? What differences in interactions do we experience based on our decisions
of what we wear? Examples: deciding not to wear makeup to a meeting with a client who has hit on you in the past; dressing in a nerd
t-shirt and jeans instead of a dress at a technical conference because you want technical conversations and not just to get hit
on; wearing a wedding ring for the same reason. What difference in interactions do we experience based on what we look like?
Examples: not getting hit on while wearing a dress at a technical conference because maybe you aren’t as “conventionally attractive”;
approachability and “resting bitch face”; not perceiving discrimination because of looking female; perceiving that people don’t take 
you seriously because you’re short, young, queer, fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also talked about ways to respond when a male colleague tells you to smile. I liked the suggestion to redirect and say, “I’m all out of smiles, but try 
[male coworker’s name] over there, I think he has some!”. What I like about it is that if a guy just says this out of habit and not malicious intent 
(which I like to think is the reason most dudes say this kind of stuff) and has never
thought about how women might not appreciate it, it doesn’t humiliate him- it just asks him to think about his action in a way he hasn’t before. 
We had a whole conversation about how for learning to happen and for behavior to change that it needs to be 
okay to make mistakes and it helps when people can talk about it with each other- especially across gender lines.
 I’ve been having this conversation since PyCon! (That’s another post)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Culture Chapter. The book talks a lot about the feminism in Women’s magazines, which I thought was a little foreign to me so I instead thought 
about Pinterest, Facebook, and ad algorithms. They recommend things to users based on all kinds of input, and what is that doing to our perception
of beauty? Another person talked about Fan Fiction and how it was interesting that so many women write about male characters, which led 
to a conversation about how male characters are relatable because they are actual people, with flaws and character, not just plot devices.
I have never read FanFic but I thought it was really interesting when someone said that fanfic allows us to create transformative works, giving an 
example of a gender-swapped Sherlock who amazingly as a woman can be just as much a culturally-accepted asshole. That’s revolutionary!!&lt;/p&gt;
